## Let's keep track of the exchanges that support Lightning Network

**Lightning Network (LNP) is a structure of payment channels open between private individuals and/or companies and represents the scaling solution for Bitcoin; that's why we often called it also the Bitcoin' Second Layer.**

With Lightning we can potentially make hundreds of thousands if not million transactions for second and so reach any part of the World (almost) instantaneously.

Lightning therefore constitutes a true P2P network , in full compliance with the abstract of the Bitcoin whitepaper created by Satoshi Nakamoto, while the Base (Settlement) Layer, with its blockchain, is more similar to a broadcast system, since the transaction transcription and so their irreversibility depends on the miners.



We will see many exchanges in the near future that will implement Lightning: it's fast, reliable, and the capacity is increasing thanks to the Wumbo channels.

My proposal is to collect the exchanges that already implemented Lightning Network or plan to do it in a simple table and keep it update.
So, let's do it!

I invite the representatives of the exchanges to signal their support to Lightning Network also in this repo.
